        transmit content or images presented on this site. Downloading is easy,
        but just because you may be able to copy our content doesn't mean you

        within your own restaurant, food service or bar operations as long as
        your membership is in good standing. Members are prohibited from sharing
        downloaded content outside of their own business entities unless their
        member subscription agreement specifically permits them to do so.
        Members who are not presently or planning to operate a food service or
        bar operation, such as consultants, vendors, suppliers or competitors of
        RestaurantOwner.com are expressly forbidden from using, modifying or
        distributing downloadable content without written permission or their
        member subscription agreement specifically permits them to do so.<br><br>

        or other commercial use is allowed in any discussion forum. No bulk

        not impersonate anyone else. <br><br>6. Treat other members with
